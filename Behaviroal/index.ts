// Behavioral design patterns are a category of design
//  patterns that focus on how objects interact and communicate
//  with each other. They help define clear communication protocols between objects, 
// making it easier to manage complex interactions and responsibilities. 
// These patterns are particularly useful in scenarios where you need to define how objects
//  should behave in response to certain events or changes in state, allowing for more flexible and
// maintainable code
